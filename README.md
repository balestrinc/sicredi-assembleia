## Architecture
Tryed to follow some concepts of hexagonal architecture where the core part (business logic) 
is loosely coupled with the "details part" like controllers and database.
The database isn't a business rule, the business rule is: "data needs to be persisted",
so the `core` does not depend directly on the repository and does not know the entity models, but on a service that stores the data instead.

If in future we need to add custom api returns for another consumer, like for a mobile app, we just need to create the appropriate convertes at `api` package and the `core` part won't need to change.

> What could be improved:
- build in separate project (gradle multi projects setup) to enforce dependency decoupling
- do not return `domain.model` directly on `api` but convert to specific response model
- isolate the service that is making requests to third-party service to validate CPF
- isolate the Messaging service from core
